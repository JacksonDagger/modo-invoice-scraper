Returns ride data from pdf Modo invoices

Put your Modo invoices in the invoices folder and fire away. Sometimes it gets stuff wrong and it doesn't register credits or late return fees (but it tells you when it sees a late return fee.) I make no warranty on the correctness of this program. It's a little personal tool that I decided to share with the world.
